# What is it?
React-Cards is my first ReactJS app.  
It does nothing publicly useful.  
It is just something that I made to get familiar with React.

## What does it do?
You have a Board that can host items called Cards.  
This app allows you to add and remove Cards from the Board.  
End of the story.

## How are Cards composed?
Each card have these properties:
- A title;
- A body;
- A remove button.
